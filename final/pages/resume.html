			<h3>Contact Information</h3>
			<ul>
				Name: <strong>Jordan Peterson</strong>
				<br>Email: jordanpete24@gmail.com (<i>prefered means of contact</i>)
				<br>Cell phone: 425-429-8665
			</ul>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<ul>
				High School
				<ul>
					<li>I graduated Richard Montgomery High School in the class of 2016
				</ul>
				College
				<ul>
					<li>I’m currently taking classes at Montgomery College, working towards the <strong>Computer Gaming and Simulation A.A.S.</strong> and <strong>Certificate</strong>; expected January 2019
					<li>Once I'm done at MC, I'm planning on getting the <strong>Simulation and Game Design</strong> degree from the University of Baltimore
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<ul>
				Cleaning 
				<ul>
					<li>I do cleaning at my Church on a regular basis, and I’m fairly familiar with normal cleaning procedures.
					<li>Timeframe: Irregularly on weekends since ~December 2014. Consistently on weekends since January 2018.
				</ul>
				Tutoring
				<ul>
					<li>I've tutored a fellow student who was taking courses revolving around using Unity to create fairly simple games, hopefully helping them more comfortably grasp the fundamentals so that they can manage the software on their own in the future.
					<li>Timeframe: February-May 2018.
				</ul>
				Groundskeeper
				<ul>
					<li>During the Summer of 2017, I worked at my Church to manage its large property (inside and out), coming every weekday to do various tasks, such as keeping the grass cut, cleaning rooms, picking weeds, dusting, vacuuming, etc.
					<li>Timeframe: May-July 2017.
				</ul>
				Seasonal Kohl's Associate
				<ul>
					<li>My primary duties consisted of unloading freight from trucks, taking contents out of packages, stocking shelves, and cleaning/organizing aisles and displays around the store. I did not work as a Cashier during this time. This was just a seasonal job, as they needed more workers during the holiday season and I wasn't particularly intending on staying long than the month of December. I mainly wanted to get some work experience.
					<li>Timeframe: December 2016.
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>Additional Skills</h3>
			<ul>
				Strong ability to work in an organized manner
				<br>
				<br>Intermediate Programming Skills with Java, Python, C#, HTML5, and CSS3
				<br>
				<br>Intermediate Experience with Unity, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Drive Suite, Microsoft Office Suite
				
			</ul>
						

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<ul>
				Organized
				<ul>
					<li>I am very organized, I'm good at keeping track of information and at making sure things are well-ordered in preparation for events.
				</ul>
				Detail-oriented
				<ul>
					<li>Going along with organized, I can work out issues and make compromises to ensure the best possible results for whatever circumstances I (or others) may be in.
				</ul>
				Dedicated
				<ul>
					<li>I will use all of the resources and time available to me to make sure that what needs to get done gets done, as best as it can be done, on time.
					<li>I am very dedicated to making sure things that I am assigned and that need to get done, get done, even if it means that I may have to spend a bit longer to make sure it is done right.
				</ul>
				Responsible
				<ul>
					<li>I take responsibility for myself, and for others (within reason), and will take the initiative to work to resolve any issues that come up, as best as I can. 
				</ul>
				I can work alone or with a group
				<ul>
					<li>I am not a particularly social person, but I can work well with groups and communicate frequently. I will tend to take a leadership position if no one else does, but I’m also willing to listen to and implement feedback. I will take on other people’s work when they do not or are unable to do it to ensure that deadlines and standards are met, but I’m also not afraid to bring up and work to resolve issues of lacking participation with members and/or higher-ups.
				</ul>
				I prefer behind-the-scenes positions
				<ul>
					<li>I can interact with customers, but I would work best at a behind-the-scenes position, as opposed to one that demands public relations and frequent, highly-personable interactions.
				</ul>
			</ul>
