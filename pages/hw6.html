				<strong><u>Contact Information</u></strong>
				<ul>
					Name: <strong>Jordan Peterson</strong>
					<br>Email: jordanpete24@gmail.com (<i>prefered means of contact</i>)
					<br>Cell phone: 425-429-8665
				</ul>

				<strong><u>Objective</u></strong>
				<ul>
					Ultimately, I would like to become a Game Designer (ideally a Systems Designer) for a video game company, or perhaps a more general position in a smaller company. Other jobs could help to build up my general work and life experience, and I'm sure I could extract useful lessons out of anything, but some jobs would definately be more valuable than others. 
				</ul>

				<strong><u>Education</u></strong>
				<ul>
					High School
					<ul>
						<li>I graduated Richard Montgomery High School in the class of 2016
					</ul>
					College
					<ul>
						<li>I’m currently taking classes at Montgomery College, working towards a <strong>Computer Gaming and Simulation A.A.S.</strong> degree
						<li>Once I'm done at MC, I'm planning on getting the <strong>Simulation and Game Design</strong> degree from the University of Baltimore
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<strong><u>Vocational Skills</u></strong>
				<ul>
					Intermediate Programming Skills
					<ul>
						<li>Java, Python, C#, HTML5, and CSS3. 
						<li>I will say that I am no master of these yet, but I may be of help in debugging errors, creating relatively simple programs or displays, and other small tasks with them (or other similar languages). I would be open to learning more if needed, ideally through a shadowing position. My basic understanding of these things helps me to problem solve and plan things out, to work out little details and make sure things work out as planned. 
					</ul>
					Intermediate Photoshop (and other 2d image-editing software) Skills
					<ul>
						<li>Depending on the desired style, I have a moderate amount of knowledge and experience with image-editing software and should be able to do touch-ups of images, create entirely new ones, or modify existing ones, for whatever may be needed.
					</ul>
					Intermediate-Advanced Document Organization Skills
					<ul>
						<li>I am fairly experienced with using various document types in order to organize, aggregate, and analyze data and information. I mainly use the Google Drive suite, but I'm sure I'd be able to use the various comparable types from Adobe, Microsoft, etc. if needed, with very little time needed to adjust. Thus far, I've really only used these for personal projects, but I use them a lot when creating Systems or Proposals for games (or various other things), tracking information on video games I play, and writing stories.
					</ul>
				</ul>
				
				<strong><u>Work Experience</u></strong>
				<ul>
					Janitor 
					<ul>
						<li>I do cleaning at my Church on a regular basis, and I’m fairly familiar with normal cleaning procedures.
						<li>Timeframe: Irregularly on weekends since ~December 2014. Consistently on weekends since January 2018.
					</ul>
					Groundskeeper
					<ul>
						<li>During the Summer of 2017, I worked at my Church to manage its large property (inside and out), coming every weekday to do various tasks, such as keeping the grass cut, cleaning rooms, picking weeds, dusting, vacuuming, etc.
						<li>Timeframe: May-July 2017.
					</ul>
					Seasonal Kohl's Associate
					<ul>
						<li>My primary duties consisted of unloading freight from trucks, taking contents out of packages, stocking shelves, and cleaning/organizing aisles and displays around the store. I did not work as a Cashier during this time. This was just a seasonal job, as they needed more workers during the holiday season and I wasn't particularly intending on staying long than the month of December. I mainly wanted to get some work experience.
						<li>Timeframe: December 2016.
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<strong><u>Hobbies</u></strong>
				<ul>
					World Creating
					<ul>
						<li>For the past 3 years or so, I have been working on creating a fictional universe, shaping it up and giving it history, characters, and detail. This takes a lot of thought, creativity, and time to think through everything. It isn’t complete, but in my opinion, one can never really be done with something like this, as it always grows and changes as you experience more of life.
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<strong><u>Personality</u></strong>
				<ul>
					Organized
					<ul>
						<li>I am very organized, I'm good at keeping track of information, and at making sure things are well-ordered in preparation for events.
					</ul>
					Detail-oriented
					<ul>
						<li>Going along with organized, I can work out issues and make compromises to ensure the best possible results for whatever circumstances I (or others) may be in.
					</ul>
					Dedicated
					<ul>
						<li>I will use all of the resources and time available to me to make sure that what needs to get done gets done, as best as it can be done, on time.
						<li>I am very dedicated to making sure things that I am assigned and that need to get done, get done, even if it means that I may have to spend a bit longer to make sure it is done right.
					</ul>
					Responsible
					<ul>
						<li>I take responsibility for myself, and for others (within reason), and will take the initiative to work to resolve any issues that come up, as best as I can. 
					</ul>
					I can work alone or with a group
					<ul>
						<li>I am not a particularly social person, but I can work well with groups and communicate frequently. I will tend to take a leadership position if no one else does, but I’m also willing to listen to and implement feedback. I will take on other people’s work when they do not or are unable to do it to ensure that deadlines and standards are met, but I’m also not afraid to bring up and work to resolve issues of lacking participation with members and/or higher-ups.
					</ul>
					I prefer behind-the-scenes positions
					<ul>
						<li>I can interact with customers, but I would work best at a behind-the-scenes position, as opposed to one that demands public relations and frequent, highly-personable interactions.
					</ul>
				</ul>
