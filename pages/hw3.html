				<h3 class="anchor" id="organized">I am Organized</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm good at keeping track of information and making sure things are in good order in preparation for major events. I often make documents or spreadsheets to organize my thoughts, notes, and so on, for personal and educational purposes.
				</ul>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="detail">I am Detail-oriented</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Going along with being organized, I've very perceptive to small details. This <i>can></i> get me caught up on them, but usually it isn't an issue. I'm good at picking up on issues before they are explicitly told to me. Identifying and being able to process many details, I can often work out issues and make compromises to ensure the best possible results for whatever circumstances I (or others) may be in.
				</ul>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="dedicated">I am Dedicated</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I will use all of the resources and time available to me to make sure that what needs to get done gets done, as best as it can be done, on time.
					<li>I am very dedicated to making sure things that I am assigned to (or that I take on) and that need to get done, get done, even if it means that I may have to spend a bit longer to make sure it is done right.
				</ul>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="responsible">I am Responsible</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I take responsibility for myself, and for others (within reason). I will also take the initiative to work to resolve any issues that come up as best as I can, but I'm comfortable with relaying issues to management if it seems necessary. 
				</ul>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="flexible">I can work alone or with a group</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I am not a particularly social person, but I can work well with groups and communicate frequently. I will tend to take a leadership position if no one else does, but I’m also willing to listen to and implement feedback. I will take on other people’s work when they do not or are unable to do it to ensure that deadlines and standards are met, but I’m also not afraid to bring up and work to resolve issues of lacking participation with members and/or higher-ups.
				</ul>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="bts">I prefer behind-the-scenes positions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I can interact with customers, but I would work best at a behind-the-scenes position, as opposed to one that demands public relations and frequent, highly-personable interactions.
				</ul>
