			<strong>Resume</strong>
		</h1>

		<p>
			<h3>Contact Information</h3>
			<ul>
				Name: <strong>Jordan Peterson</strong>
				<br>Email: jordanpete24@gmail.com (<i>prefered means of contact</i>)
				<br>Cell phone: 425-429-8665
			</ul>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<ul>
				
				<li>Richard Montgomery High School - <strong>High School Diploma</strong> - class of 2016
				<li>[In Progress] Montgomery College - <strong>Computer Gaming and Simulation A.A.S.</strong> and <strong>Certificate</strong> - expected January 2019
			</ul>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<ul>
				Cleaning 
				<ul>
					<li>I do cleaning at my Church on a regular basis, and I’m fairly familiar with normal cleaning procedures.
					<li>Timeframe: Irregularly on weekends since ~December 2014; consistently on weekends since January 2018.
				</ul>
				Groundskeeper
				<ul>
					<li>During summers, I've at my church to manage its large property (inside and out), coming every weekday to do various tasks, such as keeping the grass cut, cleaning rooms, picking weeds, dusting, vacuuming, etc.
					<li>Timeframe: May-July 2017; May-July 2018, for a few weeks.
				</ul>
				Tutoring
				<ul>
					<li>I've tutored a fellow student who was taking courses revolving around using Unity to create fairly simple games, hopefully helping them more comfortably grasp the fundamentals so that they can manage the software on their own in the future.
					<li>Timeframe: February-May 2018.
				</ul>
				Seasonal Kohl's Associate
				<ul>
					<li>My primary duties consisted of unloading freight from trucks, taking contents out of packages, stocking shelves, and cleaning/organizing aisles and displays around the store. I did not work as a Cashier during this time. This was just a seasonal job, as they needed more workers during the holiday season and I wasn't particularly intending on staying long than the month of December. I mainly wanted to get some work experience.
					<li>Timeframe: December 2016.
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>Additional Skills</h3>
			<ul>
				Strong ability to work in an organized manner
				<br>
				<br>Intermediate Programming Skills with Java, Python, C#, HTML5, and CSS3
				<br>
				<br>Intermediate Experience with Unity, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Drive Suite, Microsoft Office Suite
				
			</ul>
						

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<ul>
				Organized
				<ul>
					<li>I'm good at keeping track of information, making sure things are well-ordered, and formatting various documents and files in clean and intuitive ways.
				</ul>
				Detail-oriented
				<ul>
					<li>I pick up on many of the small details and nuances of things that may otherwise be overlooked. I can also think through issues and make compromises to ensure the best possible results for whatever circumstances I (or others) may be in.
				</ul>
				Dedicated
				<ul>
					<li>I am willing use all of the resources and time available to me to make sure that what needs to get done gets done, as best as it can be done, on time. Even when I might find it tedious or pointless. I take pride in my work being well done, first and foremost.
					<li>Sometimes I do need an explanation as to what the purpose or fundamental premise behind an assignment is if it is genuinely really unclear, lest I may become stubborn and try to find a better, more productive way to achieve and represent what I feel the goal is. This most likely would not be an issue, but I want to mention it to make it clear that I'm not entirely, blindly dedicated; my dedication roots from mutual respect and trust of capacity as well as of mutual expectation of taking on responsibility.
				</ul>
				Responsible
				<ul>
					<li>I take responsibility for myself, and for others (within reason/when applicable), and will take the initiative to work to resolve any issues that come up in a cooperative situation as best as I can. 
				</ul>
				I can work alone or with a group
				<ul>
					<li>I am not a particularly social person, but I can work well with groups and communicate clearly and frequently. I will tend to take a leadership position if no one else does, but I’m also willing to listen to and implement feedback. I will take on other people’s work when they do not or are unable to do it to ensure that deadlines and standards are met, but I’m also not afraid to bring up and work to resolve issues of lacking participation with relevant team members and/or higher-ups.
				</ul>
				I prefer behind-the-scenes positions
				<ul>
					<li>I can interact with customers, but I would work best at a behind-the-scenes position, as opposed to one that demands public relations and frequent, highly-personable interactions.
				</ul>
			</ul>
