			<h3>Education</h3>
			<ul>
				
				<li><strong>High School Diploma</strong> - Richard Montgomery High School - class of 2016
				<li><strong>Computer Gaming and Simulation A.A.S.</strong> and <strong>Certificate</strong> - Montgomery College - expected December 2018
			</ul>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<ul>
				Tutoring
				<ul>
					<li>I've tutored fellow students taking courses revolving around designing and programming games in Unity, helping them to more comfortably ease into and grasp the fundamentals so that they can manage the software on their own in the future.
					<li>Timeframe: Part-time during Spring and Fall semesters of 2018 through 2019<!--February-May 2018-->
				</ul>
				Cleaning 
				<ul>
					<li>I do cleaning at my Church on a regular basis, and I’m fairly familiar with various cleaning procedures.
					<li>Timeframe: Part-time on weekends from December 2014 to present<!--Irregularly on weekends since ~December 2014; consistently on weekends since January 2018-->
				</ul>
				Groundskeeper
				<ul>
					<li>I've worked at my church to manage its large property (inside and out), coming on weekdays to do various tasks, such as keeping the grass cut, picking weeds, cleaning rooms, dusting, vacuuming, etc.
					<li>Timeframe: Part-time on weekdays during summer in 2017 and 2018 <!--since December 2014May-July 2017; May-July 2018 -->
				</ul>		
				Seasonal Kohl's Associate
				<ul>
					<li>My primary duties consisted of unloading freight from trucks, taking contents out of packages, stocking shelves, and cleaning/organizing aisles and displays around the store. I did not work as a Cashier during this time. This was just a seasonal job, as they needed more workers during the holiday season and I wasn't particularly intending on staying long than the month of December. I mainly wanted to get some work experience.
					<li>Timeframe: Part-time during the holiday season of 2016 <!--December 2016-->
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>Additional Skills</h3>
			<ul>
				Strong ability to work in an organized manner
				<br>
				<br>Intermediate Programming Skills with Java, Python, C#, HTML5, and CSS3
				<br>
				<br>Intermediate Experience with Unity, Maya, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Drive Suite, Microsoft Office Suite
				
			</ul>
						

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<ul>
				Organized
				<ul>
					<li>I'm good at keeping track of information and deadlines, making sure things are well-ordered, and formatting various documents and files in clean and intuitive ways.
				</ul>
				Detail-oriented
				<ul>
					<li>I pick up on many of the small details and nuances of things that may otherwise be overlooked. I can also think through issues and make balanced compromises to ensure the best possible results for whatever circumstances I (or others) may be in.
				</ul>
				Dedicated
				<ul>
					<li>I am willing to use all of the resources and time available to me to make sure that what needs to get done gets done, as best as it can be done, on time. Even when I might find it tedious. I take pride in my work being well done, first and foremost.
					<li>Sometimes I do need an explanation as to what the purpose or fundamental premise behind an assignment is if it is genuinely really unclear, or else I may become stubborn and try to find a better, more productive way to achieve and represent what I feel the goal is. This most likely would not be an issue, but I want to mention it to make it clear that I'm not entirely, blindly dedicated; my dedication roots from feeling confident via mutual respect, trust in my capabilities, and trust in my commitment to responsibility. 
				</ul>
				Responsible
				<ul>
					<li>I take responsibility for myself and others (when applicable and within reason), and will take the initiative to work to resolve any issues that come up in a cooperative situation as best as I can. I work to try to improve upon any shortcomings for the future.
				</ul>
				I can work alone or with a group
				<ul>
					<li>I am not a particularly social person, but I can work well with groups and communicate clearly and frequently. I will tend to take a leadership position if no one else does, but I’m also willing to seriously and sincerely listen to and implement feedback. I will take on other people’s work when they do not or are unable to do it to ensure that deadlines and standards are met, but I’m also not afraid to bring up and work to resolve issues of lacking participation with relevant team members and/or higher-ups.
				</ul>
				I prefer behind-the-scenes positions
				<ul>
					<li>I can interact with customers, but I work best at a behind-the-scenes position as opposed to one that demands public relations and frequent, highly-personable interactions with unfamiliar individuals.
				</ul>
			</ul>
