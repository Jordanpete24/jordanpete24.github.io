			<h5 id="unity">Game and Simulation with Unity</h5>
			<ul>
				This course was focused on introducing students to the Unity environment. We had several fairly simple game projects assigned to us, as well as two group projects where we needed to coordinate between members in order to create a unified theme and compile all of our assets together so that we could export it successfully. Overall, it was a really valuable experience for me because it helped to stengthen much of the programming experience I've obtained prior to the course but that I never really had the ability to fully grasp because I had never used a development environment that could help to render and manage the parts that weren't just the logic-based code, which was my strong-point prior to the class. Since I found the class fairly easy, at least on the programming side, I used many of the projects as a base from which I could expand and make a far more complex game than was originally assigned. The Forest of Sharill is an example of that, which can be seen <a href="../pages/forestofsharill.html">here</a>; it was assigned to be a fairly simple text adventure game with perhaps 15 "areas", but I've turned it into an entire open-world map.
				<br><br><strong>Take-aways</strong>: I gained a lot of experience with Unity, added C# to my programming languages, got some experience working with groups (often leading them), and made several projects that I'm really proud of.
			</ul>
			<h5 id="worldmythology">World Mythology</h5>
			<ul>
				This course introduced me to many different myths throughout history, from around the world. I really enjoyed seeing the common themes that many of them shared, such as heros, fertility, tricksters, and so on. And the small or even large differences in details or even fundamental premises was both interesting and eye-opening. It helped me get a wider perspective on various cultures, and also helped to give me some insight into the more raw human experience, which is what some people describe myths to be. 
				<br><br><strong>Take-aways</strong>: I gained appreciation and a deeper understanding of various cultures, learned a bit more about history, and perhaps most practically, I learned about some of the fundamental human needs and experiences that most humans, but especially humans early in a civilization's development, experience. This will all be helpful to apply to game development as well as my fantasy story/novel in the form of realistic, rich history and world building.
			</ul>
			<h5 id="creativewriting">Creative Writing</h5>
			<ul>
				This course focused on both reading and writing contemporary fiction short stories. That was a genre that I hadn't really been exposed to prior to the course, and I must say I haven't fallen in love with it since, but I do appreciate that it can have a lot of value. Something that I perhaps somewhat strange about me is that I kind of enjoy writing, but I really don't like reading, and I'm generally really slow about it (both as a result of that, and as a motivator of it). But I'm fairly good at anaylzing texts as well as editting it. So I did enjoy the classroom discussions that we had about the short stories we read, and I really liked the workshops we had for several student's work, mine included. I found that experience, on both sides of it, quite helpful for growth as a writer. I did get the chance to write a few more fantasy-oriented short stories throughout the course, but contemporary fiction was the majority of our assignments, and having to write in that genre, even though I wasn't particularly comfortable with it, was fairly helpful for expanding my scope as well as honing my preferences and style.
				<br><br><strong>Take-aways</strong>: I got some first-hand experience doing a workshop, which provided me with a lot of feedback. I also was exposed to a lot of new ideas and themes that I hadn't been entirely familiar with. along with general do's and dont's of writing, which is all important as a writer of any kind. And I also got experience with analyzing and writing stories with fairly limited time constraints, which helped to expose me to the reality of limited time-tables in essentially all creative workspaces.
			</ul>
			<h5 id="animation">2D Animation</h5>
			<ul>
				This course focused on introducing the fundamentals of 2D animation, using the Adobe Animate program. I personally found the lectures, each of which provided useful information about how animation works, as well as ways to make it convincing, realistic, and both simpler and complex to be incredibly enlightening, and it certainly gave me much more appreciation for the talent and time commitment that animation takes. The workload was quite a lot, and required a lot of out-of-class work, at least with the scale of the projects I had committed to; while I was proud of my work, it gave me context and a pretty good gauge of how to best plan and account for the development process of animations. 
				<br><br>My final project, a short animation video (about 70 seconds), can be found <a href="../pages/astrollthroughthewoods.html">here</a>. 
				<br><br><strong>Take-aways</strong>: Personally, I'm much more focused on the programming/design side of game development than I am on the art side, but considering that both of those fields are integral parts of the gaming industry, which I want to get into, it is important that I learn about and really have a good understanding of what my team-mates and/or other teams in the company have on their shoulders, to better be able to plan and account for them and what sort of time commitment would be required for any given assignment that they might have or that I might give to them. I feel like this course has given me a good basic understanding of these considerations, but I'm sure that the 3D Animation course that I have ahead of me will continue to shed more light on it.
