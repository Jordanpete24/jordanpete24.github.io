			I appreciate Reddit as a website because it offers a great platform to interact with people who share common interests and personalities. Whether it be for gaming communities, humor, news and politics, etc., it offers a wonder place for communities to interact, utilizing some of the features and functionalities of Web 3.0 to their extreme.

			I appreciate Youtube as a website because it offers a great platform to consume content. It is not as great as something like Reddit for interacting with an audience/community, but it can be fairly good at that, as well as interacting with the creator(s). It is a great place to see tutorials, music, entertainment, reviews, etc. And I appreciate the difficult situation that they're in regarding monetization, ads, and so on, which is an area of large contention currently.
