			<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
			Hi, I'm Jordan Peterson. I'm currently a student at the University of Baltimore working towards the <strong>Simulation and Game Design B.S.</strong> degree. 
			<br><br>
			<h3 class="anchor" id="goals">My Goals</h3>
			Currently, my primary career aspiration is to work at a game studio, probably as a programmer or systems designer. For the past few years, I've been somewhat unsure of if I wanted to commit fully to this or perhaps some other field, such as creative writing, psychology, or history, as I really enjoy them all. However, they all do feed into various parts of making games, so I've decided that, for now, I'll give the game industry a shot, especially since there's a decent number of game studios around Maryland. I'm excited about the prospect of it, even though I know it's a very competitive industry.
			<br><br>
			<h3 class="anchor" id="goals">Background of my interest in game development</h3>
			For over ten years, I've been passionate about various video games. However, I've mostly been interested in MMORPG's. I've been captivated by the worlds that they can bring to life, the complex mechanics that they can employ, the social environments that can be cultivated, and the persistent worlds and characters that you can meet and become a part of. 
			<br><br>I'm generally a fairly casual player, and I usually don't play in competitive gamemodes. However, I still like to learn as much as I can about the games and their systems so that I can be as knowledgeable about them as possible, for the rare times I either engage with it, or just so that I can get a better grasp of how the systems in the game overlap and interact with one another. My desire to understand systems has helped me develop an ability to pinpoint some of the more annoying aspects of game design and user experience, which has helped me to avoid some of those issues in the games I've worked on. 
			<br><br>I want systems to be enjoyable, intuitive, simple, and meaningful, and whenever I think a system is lacking, in my own games or ones I'm playing, I'll try to think through ways that the system could meet those requirements better. Over time, I've realized the limits of development resources, the need for monetization of certain aspects of development, and so on, and I have tried to structure my ideas around those limitations accordingly, especially when they are suggestions being made with the intention of studios listening to them. Speaking of which, some of these suggestions can be found on my <a href="../pages/suggestedsystems.html#header">Suggested Systems</a> page; some of the ideas have been implemented in some form by the respective studios, while others have not, though I don't claim credit for any of them.
