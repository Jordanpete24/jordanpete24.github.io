			Hi, I'm Jordan Peterson.
			<br>
			<br>Currently, I'm a student at Montgomery College. My current educational focus is around Video Game Design. I'm taking the <strong>Computer Gaming and Simulation AAS</strong> and <strong> Certificate</strong>, which I should have by the end of the Fall 2018 Semester, and then I'll be working towards the <strong>Simulation and Game Design</strong> degree at the University of Baltimore (at Shady Grove).
			<br>
			<br>For over ten years, I've been passionate about various video games, but most especially MMORPG's. I've been captivated by the worlds that they can bring to life, the fun mechanics that they can employ, the social environments that can be cultivated, and the persistent worlds and characters that you can meet and become a part of. I'm generally a fairly casual player, usually not playing particularly competitive gamemodes, but I still like learn as much as I can about the games and their systems so that I can be as efficient as I can in the time that I do play them. This desire to understand systems, as well as the discovery of annoying aspects of them in the process, has made me very passionate and fairly knowledgeable about system design, especially in video games. I want systems to be enjoyable, intuitive, simple, and meaningful, and whenever I think a system is lacking, in my own games or ones I'm playing, I'll try to think through ways that the system could meet those requirements better. Over time, I've realized the limits of development resources, the need for monetization of certain aspects of development, and so on, and I have tried to structure my ideas around those limitations accordingly. 
			<br>
			<br>If you're interested, you can check out my <a href="../pages/suggestedsystems.html#header">Suggested Systems</a> page if you want an overview of some of the system revamps I've suggested be done to existing games. I will note that I've never gotten to implement the ideas myself, mainly because I've never had the opportunity to do them, especially since most of them are not mod-able in the context of them often being in online games. But some of them have been implemented by the respective studios, more or less (of course, I can't and don't claim full credit, not even for the ideas).
			<br>
			<h3 class="anchor" id="goals">My Goals</h3>
			Currently, my primary career aspiration is working at a game studio. For the past few years, I've been unsure of if I wanted to commit fully to this or perhaps some other field, such as creative writing, psychology, history, or even science, as I really enjoy them all. But for now, I've decided that I'll try to get into the gaming industry, especially since there's a decent number of game studios around Maryland. I'm excited about the prospect of it, even though I know it's a very competitive industry.
			<br>
			<br>Creatively, and purely as a hobby (at least for now), I would also like to eventually finish and publish the fantasy story I'm working on. I don't know if there's an audience for it, and it's far too early for me to start marketing it, but I tend to believe that if you do something you're genuinely passionate about and flesh it out to the point that it's honestly compelling to yourself, people will find it and love it all the more.
