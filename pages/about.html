			<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
			Hello! I'm Jordan Peterson. I'm currently a student at the University of Baltimore working towards the <strong>Simulation and Game Design B.S.</strong> degree, with a focus on programming. 
			<br><br> Feel free to read more about me or take a look around at some of my Projects.
			<br><br>
			<h3 class="anchor" id="goals">Career Goals</h3>
			Currently, my primary career aspiration is to work at a game studio as a systems designer. However, I feel that my skillsets would also orient me well in gameplay programming, quality assurance, or possibly systems programming. 
			<br><br>In the past I've been somewhat unsure of what I wanted to fully commit to because I've had an interest in a number of fields besides game development, including creative writing, psychology, and history. I've decided to focus in on game development for the time being, and I feel that my interest in those other fields feed into that decision and can help strengthen how I understand and approach game development, since they are each relevant to certain aspects of game development. 
			<br><br>
			<h3 class="anchor" id="goals">Background in Game Development</h3>
			For over ten years, I've been passionate about various video games. I've mostly taken interest in MMORPGs. I've been captivated by the worlds that they can bring to life, the complex mechanics that they are made up of, the social environments that can be cultivated, and the persistent worlds and characters that you can meet and become a part of. 
			<br><br>I'm a fairly casual player, often steering clear of competitive game modes. However, I still like to learn as much as I can about a game and their systems so that I can be as knowledgeable about them as possible for the rare times I engage with it or just so that I can get a better grasp of how the systems in the game overlap and interact with one another. My desire to understand systems has helped me develop an ability to pinpoint some of the pain points of game design and user experience, which has helped me to avoid some of those issues in the games I've worked on. 
			<br><br>I want systems to be enjoyable, intuitive, simple, and meaningful, and whenever I think a system is lacking, in my own games or ones I'm playing, I'll try to think through ways that the system could meet those requirements better. Through this practice, I've realized the limits of development resources, the need for monetization of certain aspects of development, and so on, and I have tried to structure my ideas around those limitations accordingly, especially when they are suggestions being made with the intention of studios listening to them. Some of these suggestions can be found on my <a href="../pages/suggestedsystems.html#header">Suggested Systems</a> page. Some of the ideas have been implemented in one form or another by the respective studios, though I don't claim credit for any of them.	
			<br><br>More recently, I've worked on producing smaller game projects. Many have been for school, though others have been worked on by myself or for group game jams. I've always tried to push myself in every project I work on to experiment with unfamiliar functionality and to try to build things in modular, robust ways.
